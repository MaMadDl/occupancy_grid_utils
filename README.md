# occupancy_grid_utils
Forked from https://kforge.ros.org/gridutils/git with Catkinizing changes. The package contains utilities for dealing with occupancy grids, represented as nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid objects, including coordinate conversions, shortest paths, ray tracing, and constructing from laser scans.
